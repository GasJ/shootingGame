# shootingGame
Create simple AI for a top down shooter, it is recommended that you recycle some of the code from assignment 2 to reduce the effort. Some of the specifications in this assignment are from the previous assignment, and are potential easy marks.
Character
• The character should be an animated sprite with shooting and walk
animations, able to walk in a straight line, and turn.
• The character should have a bazooka or rocket launcher type weapon that
fires relatively slowly and only shoots forward.
• If the player dies, the game resets
Enemies
• Enemies should spawn at 4 locations on the map, not more than once every 5
seconds
• If a rocket collides with an enemy, the enemy lose one of their three hit
points.
• If an enemy collides with the player the player should die.
Enemy AI
• Implement the attached decision tree. 
• Add comments to the top of the AI script denoting the values chosen for
threshold parameters and why those values were chosen. 
Environment 
• The environment should be bounded to a single screen (player must stay
within view)
• The background (floor) should have a texture.
• There should be no obstacles in the room.
• Add a taunt behaviour which triggers randomly if the player is out of
THREAT_RANGE as part of the idle animation (now 3 states for idle: wander, idle animation, taunt.
